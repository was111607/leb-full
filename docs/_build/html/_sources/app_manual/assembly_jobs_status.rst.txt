   **Jobs Status dialog**

Notes
^^^^^

* We should modify this table to include batch jobs rather than single strain job
* A link for each batch should be provided so the user can check the status of each strain
* The previous link will open other dialog which allow the user to:
    * check the status of the assembly,
    * alert metadata,
    * provide new read files in case of the assembly job failed due to read files
    * submit the strains metadata along with read files to Warwick EnteroBase.
* The previous functions are not implemented yet
