Approving Your Local EnteroBase
--------------------------------

* Following a successful upload test, which verifies that your Local EnteroBase is correctly installed and configured, you must contact a Central EnteroBase admin to approve your Local EnteroBase instance, providing your name, organisation/institution, and the name of your Local EnteroBase instance.
* **For the beta test**, please contact Harry who is acting as the Central EnteroBase admin (h.fallows@warwick.ac.uk)
* Feel free to leave the page until you have been emailed again, you will automatically be returned to this page when you revisit the website.
* The Central EnteroBase Admin will email back your Central EnteroBase OAuth tokens that enable you to fully utilise Local EnteroBase using your Central EnteroBase credentials. The OAuth tokens are a client ID and client secret.
* When you enter the client ID and client secret into the form, it will expand to show the details that Central EnteroBase has about your Local EnteroBase instance for you to verify your details. If the details match up, press "confirm" to submit them. You will be redirected to the homepage where you can sign in using your Central EnteroBase OAuth credentials.
* If you expect your details store by Central EnteroBase to change whilst keeping the client ID and client secret the same, press "resubmit" to refresh the retrieved details.
* If Central EnteroBase does not have details associated with your submitted credentials, an error message will display. It is suggested that you contact a Central EnteroBase admin.
