Welcome to the Local EnteroBase Beta Test!
============================================

Thank you for participating in our beta test! The purpose of the test is to gather user experience feedback on the installation and configuration processes, in addition to the usage of the web interface that we have developed.
The team will be on hand to provide support during the beta test, the main person of contact is Will Sewell (w.sewell@warwick.ac.uk), please reach out if you have any questions or queries!

The main purpose of Local EnteroBase is to enable users to locally assemble their read files and send the strain metadata, along with the assembly files, to the Central EnteroBase hosted at Warwick.
