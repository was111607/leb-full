* If you have previously signed in with Central EnteroBase and navigate to any of the 'locked' functions, you will be automatically signed in and redirected to the respective webpage.
* The homepage provides the ability to switch between a dark and a light theme using the icon in the top navigation bar next to the login buttons.
* The following sections detail the log in process as well as provide an overview of the available Local EnteroBase functions. Further detail on their operations can be found within their individual user guide sections.

Databases to Upload Strains
======================================

As demonstrated in figure 1, the available databases for the principal genera stored and analysed using EnteroBase are displayed on the homepage. If you know the strains you will intend to upload, you can select a specific genera database from
those displayed to upload your strains and their metadata. Clicking on a database will redirect you to their respective strain submission webpage.

Your Jobs
============

When you submit strains to be assembled within Local EnteroBase, these processes are transformed into 'jobs' and queued to be operated on in the background with Celery.
This webpage allows you to view the statuses of all submitted jobs, being 'queued' or 'completed' and providing further options to upload the results to Central EnteroBase
and download the results.
