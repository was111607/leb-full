Automatic vs Manual Installation

There are two available options to install Local EnteroBase. Manually, or using an installation script. The script has been tested on the following distributions: Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04, Fedora 32, Fedora 33, CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Debian 9, and Debian 10. The automatic installer is simpler to get started with but if you are not using any of the listed distributions, please refer to the manual installation instructions. if you run into any issues, please refer to the manual installation documentation, or contact the beta testing team.

Additional Information
=======================

* If you would like to test multiple instances of the singularity container running, you would need an additional VM for a separate instance of NGINX to run.
